# Covid_counties
My aim in this project is to analyse and visualise amount of covid cases in each US county against various social and economic factors. In order to do so I decided to develop a database which include data from multiples sources. The whole process is done using:
* Spark
* Airflow
* Postgres
<a/>
The whole app is containerized with Docker.
